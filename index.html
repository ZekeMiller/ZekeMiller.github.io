			<h3 id="employment_history">Employment History</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Construction Assistant (2012 - 2015)
						<p>
							Assisted in hanging sheets of drywall.  This was essentially an allowance job in which I worked for my dad during the summer, but I believe it exemplifies my dedication and work ethic well, as I did have responsibilities.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Network Technician (August 2016 - Current<sup>*</sup>)
						<p>
							Employed at Jersey Shore Area School District as a part of the Technology Team.  I worked maintaining, repairing, and upgrading networking and other computer equipment such as Desktop PCs, laptops, printers, switches, access points, and servers.  This began as a co-op position during my Senior Year of High School, but has since become full-time.
						</p>
						<p>
							<sup>*</sup>The position is available to me during my summer breaks, holiday breaks, or even remotely if I am available to work.  I have been working on projects for the district from RIT in my free time.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h3 id="professional_interests">Professional Interests</h3>
				<p>
					I am interested in a variety of computing fields, specifically Software Engineering and Networking and Systems Administration.  I am interested in a career involving both Networking and Software Engineering, although I am not sure exactly of a specific position for which both skillsets are required.

		<a href="http://github.com/ZekeMiller/rubiks-cube"><h2 id="rubiks">Rubik's Cube Solver Project</h2></a>
			<div>
				<p>
					For several years now, 'cubing' has been a favorite hobby of mine.  I own several rubik's cubes, as well as quite a few similar puzzles, such as a 2x2x2, a 4x4x4, a 5x5x5, a pyraminx, and a megaminx.  In fact, I've started a rubik's cube related passion project.
					It started as me trying to figure out how to store a rubik's cube state, and how to modify it in predictable ways (individual turns).  I then made a way for the program to recognize turns in <a href="https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/">Standard Notation</a> as commands, perform them, and print the new cube position.
				</p>
				<p>
					From there, I figured out how to map algorithm names to a string version of the list of names, so that the user can call an algorithm instead of individual moves.  The biggest hurdle so far has been adding the functionality for the program to solve the cube, and tell the user exactly what moves to do to solve it as well.  In order to compliment this, I added functionality for the user to input a scrambled cube, face by face, and on the condition that it is legally solvable, the program will solve it.  One of the toughest parts of letting a user submit data on their own was to map the data to the structure I used to store positions and colors.  I have plans to add some verification to check whether or not the cube is solvable, and tell the user if they have inputted an illegal position. All of is be hosted at <a href="https://github.com/ZekeMiller/rubiks-cube">this GitHub page</a>.
					My future plans for the project are to:
					<div>
						My future plans for the project are to:
						<ol>
							<li>Create a rendered visual representation (first 2d folded, later 3D) of the cube (with buttons to do moves)</li>
							<li>Allow the user to use a color palette to input cube positions into the visual representation of the cube</li>
						</ol>
						I will likely continue to add to the project, as I quite enjoy rubik's cubes, programming, and learning, and this project combines all three.

				<h3>Games</h3>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>Board/Tabletop Games</h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								I enjoy lots of strategy and roleplaying games, such as Dungeons and Dragons, Chess, Catan, and Stratego.  One common board game that a lot of people seem to think I would like is monopoly, but I just don't enjoy it as much as other games that rely less on chance (except Dungeons and Dragons but that's fun for the roleplaying)
							</p>
						</div></li>
						<li><h4>Video Games</h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								I also enjoy casually playing video games, ranging from action/shooter games such as Blizzard's Overwatch, to puzzlers, platformers, or even puzzle-platformers, such as Braid, LIMBO, INK, and the famous Portal games.  I've noticed that I like puzzlers and platformers more when playing a singleplayer game, but can play and enjoy anything with friends.
							</p>
						</div></li>
						<li><h4>Sports</h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								I have tried many sports, including baseball, basketball, soccer, tennis, cross country, and track and field, and have discovered two things.  The first is that I tend to really enjoy racquet/paddle sports, such as tennis, pickleball, racquetball, and ping-pong.  The second is that I like to play sports that I can have fun playing, with people that make it fun.  For example, I started out playing basketball for a local team, but didn't like it.  Years later I played a few times with co-workers that I am very close with, and had a fantastic time.
							</p>
						</div></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h3>Computers (and stuff)</h3>
				<div>
					<p>
						I've always been interested in computers, which is naturally why I am in a computing major.  My freshman year of high school, I saved my money, did my research and ended up building my own Desktop PC.  I have since maintained and upgraded the same<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">?</a></sup> PC, toyed with it countless times (including a few times where I managed to break it and had to figure out what I screwed up).
